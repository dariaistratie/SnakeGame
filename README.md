# SnakeGame
This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the turtle module. The player controls a snake that moves across the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.

Features:
Snake Movement: The snake can move in four directions using arrow keys.
Food Spawning: Randomly placed food that increases the snake's length upon consumption.
Scoreboard: Displays the current score and shows "GAME OVER" when the game ends.
Collision Detection: Detects collisions with walls and the snakeâ€™s own body, ending the game if necessary.
